## Setting up Docker on Mac M1

Docker Desktop: [download and install](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/apple-silicon/).

## AI things

- Python's libraries are given in [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt).
- Currently (11 Jul 21), there is no docker things for AI. **We have to install things directly on Mac**! 👉🏻 Read [this note](https://dinhanhthi.com/getting-start-data-science-machine-learning-on-mac-m1/)!

``` bash
# Install packages in requirement.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
